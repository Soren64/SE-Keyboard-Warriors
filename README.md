# SWE: KEYBOARD WARRIORS

- Team Members: Nena Heng, Katiana Sourn, Raj Ray, Nicholas Matsuda, Anthony Simao
- Project Name: Keyboard Warriors
- Date Completed: 12/9/2024

## Description:
The general subject area we decided to implement for the game is typing; more specifically typing speed and accuracy, however we decided to also include aspects that covered spelling, and vocabulary. Keyboard Warriors will include a challenging level based system where each level increases in difficulty. The levels will consist of fruit-like enemies that the gamer must defeat by typing in pre-generated sentences at a fast pace. The damage will scale to the degree of success on the Player's turn. The remaining enemies are able to fight back. In each level on the enemies' turn, the gamer will be presented with vocabulary questions that they must answer promptly if they want to keep moving forward. The game offers age-appropriate challenges that allow players to develop both typing accuracy and vocabulary comprehension in a fun, interactive setting. The game is currently available for download on the project website, however it may be listed on digital marketplaces after completion.

## Functionality:
The game has five screens: the main menu, game screen, win screen, lose screen, and a completed game screen. When the player opens the game, they are met with three options. They can start a new game, load existing save data, or exit the game. Clicking either "Start" or "Load" will go to the game screen. The player will be met with their character, the enemy/enemies, the sentence required to be typed, the current turn (which starts with the player), character health (starts at 3) and a timer. Once the player starts typing the sentence, the text will highlight any correct letters green and the next to-be-typed character as pink. Once the sentence is completely typed, the enemy will be defeated. If it is not typed in time, a three-choice question will appear that is of middle-school level. If the player choses the right answer, they lose no health and can continue to type. If the player choses the wrong answer, they lose one health and continue to type. Health sort of acts as lives in this situaton. If the last enemy is defeated, the player will be met with the win screen where they can continue or go back to the main menu.

There are five levels, so once the player beats the fifth level, they are met with the completed game screen. They can choose to play from the beginning by clicking the "Level 1" button, go back to the main menu, or exit the game. Every level updates the save data corresponding to that level and the player can choose to reload this data if they exit the game and come back.

## How to run:
To run the game, download and unzip the archive into a folder. Open the folder and simply click the "KeyboardWarriors.exe" file to play and it will open up the game's window. On the browser version, it can be found on the project website in the "ABOUT" section.
